We are talking about processor programming in stationeers game.

Sure, I'm familiar with programming in the Stationeers game. What do you need help with specifically?
Andrey Borisov (Boris)
There are some assets named as a communication antenna. It has vertical and horizontal angle and the signal level corresponding to that angles. If we have 3 independent antennas with there own predefined angle settings and corresponding signal level how we can defined the angle for another antenna in a way the signal level will be maximal?

To find the optimal angle for a fourth antenna based on the signal levels of three existing antennas, you can use a method called triangulation. Triangulation is a way to determine the location of an unknown point based on its distance from three known points.

In this case, we can consider each of the three antennas as a known point, with its horizontal and vertical angle as the coordinates. We also have the signal strength at each antenna.

We can then calculate the distance from the unknown point (the location of the fourth antenna) to each of the three known points, based on the signal strength at each point. The distance can be calculated using the formula:

distance = 10^(signal level / -20)

where the signal level is in decibels (dB).

Once we have the distances, we can use them to calculate the coordinates of the unknown point using trilateration. Trilateration is a method of determining the position of an unknown point by forming and solving equations based on the distances to three known points.

This can be done using a system of equations, where each equation represents the distance from the unknown point to one of the known points. The equations can be solved to find the coordinates of the unknown point.

Once we have the coordinates of the unknown point, we can convert them into horizontal and vertical angles for the fourth antenna. These angles will correspond to the direction in which the fourth antenna should be pointed to receive the maximum signal strength.

Let's say the signal source is far far away so the distance between antennas is not an issue

In that case, we can use a mathematical optimization algorithm to find the optimal angles for the new antenna. One such algorithm is the gradient descent algorithm.

We can define a cost function that takes in the angles of the new antenna and outputs the signal strength based on the signal levels and angles of the three independent antennas. We can then use the gradient descent algorithm to minimize this cost function and find the optimal angles.

The cost function can be defined as follows:

scss

f(theta) = -((s1 * cos(theta - a1) + s2 * cos(theta - a2) + s3 * cos(theta - a3))^2 + (s1 * sin(theta - a1) + s2 * sin(theta - a2) + s3 * sin(theta - a3))^2)

where theta is the angle of the new antenna, a1, a2, and a3 are the angles of the three independent antennas, s1, s2, and s3 are the signal levels of the three independent antennas.

The negative of the square of the magnitude of the signal vector is used as the cost function. The gradient descent algorithm can then be applied to this cost function to find the optimal angle for the new antenna.

The steps of the gradient descent algorithm are as follows:

    Initialize the angle of the new antenna theta to a random value.
    Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to theta.
    Update theta by subtracting the gradient multiplied by a small learning rate.
    Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the change in the cost function becomes negligible or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

With this approach, we can find the optimal angle for the new antenna that maximizes the signal strength based on the angles and signal levels of the three independent antennas.

Could you make me a picture shown this?

I'm sorry, as a language model, I cannot generate images. However, I can describe how the antennas can be positioned for maximum signal strength.

Assuming we have three antennas labeled A, B, and C, each with their own predefined angle settings and corresponding signal levels:

    Determine the angle of arrival of the signal by using the signal level and angle information from each of the three antennas.
    Point the new antenna in the direction of the angle of arrival.
    Adjust the vertical and horizontal angles of the new antenna to maximize the signal level.

To visualize this, imagine three antennas pointing in different directions, each with a signal strength meter showing the signal level and an angle indicator showing the angle of the incoming signal. The new antenna would be positioned to point in the direction of the strongest signal, and then adjusted to maximize the signal level by adjusting the vertical and horizontal angles.
Andrey Borisov (Boris)
Is it possible to calculate it at once not using iterations?
!

Yes, it is possible to calculate it without using iterations by using linear algebra techniques. We can represent the problem as a system of linear equations and solve it using matrix algebra.

Let's say we have three antennas A, B, and C with their corresponding angles and signal levels represented as (θ₁, φ₁, s₁), (θ₂, φ₂, s₂), and (θ₃, φ₃, s₃), respectively. We want to find the optimal angle (θ, φ) for another antenna D such that the signal level is maximal.

We can represent the problem as a system of linear equations:

scss

cos(θ) * sin(φ) = A
sin(θ) * sin(φ) = B
cos(φ) = C

where A, B, and C are constants that depend on the angles and signal levels of the three antennas A, B, and C.

We can rewrite the equations in matrix form:

css

[cos(θ)  sin(θ)   0]   [sin(φ)]   [A]
[-sin(θ)  cos(θ)   0] * [sin(φ)] = [B]
[   0       0     cos(φ)]   [1  ]    [C]

where the first matrix on the left represents the rotation matrix, the second matrix on the left represents the vector of spherical coordinates, and the rightmost column represents the constants.

We can solve the system of linear equations using matrix inversion:

css

[cos(θ)  sin(θ)   0]   [sin(φ)]   [A]
[-sin(θ)  cos(θ)   0] * [sin(φ)] = [B]
[   0       0     cos(φ)]   [1  ]    [C]

[cos(θ) -sin(θ)  0]   [sin(φ)]   [A]
[sin(θ)  cos(θ)  0] * [sin(φ)] = [B]
[   0       0     1]   [cos(φ)]   [C]

[cos(θ) -sin(θ)  0]   [sin(φ)]   [A]
[sin(θ)  cos(θ)  0] * [sin(φ)] = [B]
[   0       0     1]   [cos(φ)]   [C]

[cos(θ) -sin(θ)]
